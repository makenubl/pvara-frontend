## 💰 Business Case Summary

### Problem
- 1M applications/day
- Can't review manually (would need 250+ HR staff)
- Current HR capacity: insufficient
- Manual process: too slow, too expensive

### Solution
- AI Screening Agent (using LLMs)
- Automatic pre-screening (2-6 sec per candidate)
- HR reviews shortlist (top 10-100)
- 70-80% reduction in manual work

### Results
```
BEFORE (Manual only):
├─ Cost: $2.46M/month (HR salaries)
├─ Time: 3+ months to generate shortlist
├─ Staff: 250+ HR team members
└─ Error rate: 5-10%

AFTER (Hybrid: AI + Human):
├─ Cost: $165K/month
├─ Time: <1 hour to generate shortlist
├─ Staff: 10 HR team members
└─ Error rate: 2-5%

ROI: 
├─ Savings: $27.5M/year (93% reduction)
├─ Year 1 ROI: 50x
├─ Payback: 1.5 weeks
└─ Year 2+: Infinite
