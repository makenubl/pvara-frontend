# 🚀 PVARA Portal - Netlify Deployment Guide

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [x] Build compiles successfully
- [x] All tests passing (4/4)
- [x] All code committed to GitHub
- [x] netlify.toml configured
- [x] Environment variables documented

## 📋 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify CLI (Recommended for Testing)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy the build folder
netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
```

### Option 2: GitHub Integration (Recommended for Production)

1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Select "GitHub"
4. Connect your GitHub account
5. Select repository: `pvara-frontend`
6. Build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
7. Click "Deploy site"

Netlify will automatically:
- Build your app on every push to main
- Deploy to production
- Set up automatic HTTPS

### Option 3: Manual Drag & Drop

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Drag and drop the `build` folder
3. Your site is live! (temporary URL)

## 📝 Configuration

### netlify.toml (Already Configured)

```toml
[build]
command = "npm run build"
publish = "build"

[[redirects]]
from = "/*"
to = "/index.html"
status = 200
```

This configuration:
- Builds with: `npm run build`
- Publishes from: `build/` directory
- Redirects all routes to index.html (for React routing)

## 🔐 Environment Variables

### Frontend Environment Variables

Set in Netlify dashboard (Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment):

```
REACT_APP_ENV=production
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
```

### Backend Environment Variables (if using Netlify Functions)

```
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 📊 Site Configuration

### After Deployment

1. **Custom Domain**
   - Site settings → Domain management
   - Add your custom domain
   - Configure DNS

2. **HTTPS**
   - Automatically enabled by Netlify
   - Free Let's Encrypt certificate

3. **Analytics**
   - Netlify Analytics available
   - Monitor traffic and performance

4. **Builds**
   - Netlify builds on every push
   - View build logs
   - Rollback if needed

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

Every push to `main` branch will:
1. Trigger a Netlify build
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Deploy to production (if build succeeds)
4. Update your live site

### Deployment Workflow

```
Git Push to main
    ↓
GitHub notifies Netlify
    ↓
Netlify clones repository
    ↓
npm install
    ↓
npm run build
    ↓
Build folder deployed
    ↓
Site goes live ✅
```

## 📱 What Gets Deployed

The `build/` folder contains:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `static/js/main.*.js` - React app (minified)
- `static/css/main.*.css` - Styles (minified)
- `static/media/` - Images and assets
- `manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- `robots.txt` - SEO configuration

## ✅ Verification

After deployment, verify:

```bash
# Check build was successful
# Site status shows "Published"

# Test your domain
curl https://your-site.netlify.app

# Check responsive design
# Open on mobile, tablet, desktop

# Test all features
# Create job, apply, check status updates
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

1. Check Netlify build logs
2. Run `npm run build` locally
3. Check for errors in console
4. Verify all dependencies installed

### Site Not Loading

1. Check if publish directory is `build`
2. Verify netlify.toml redirects are set
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check domain DNS settings

### Styles Not Loading

1. Check CSS file was built
2. Verify build size: `ls -lh build/static/css/`
3. Check network tab in DevTools
4. Clear Netlify cache: Site settings → Build & deploy → Trigger deploy

### Deployment Too Slow

1. Check bundle size: `npm run build`
2. Optimize large dependencies
3. Consider code splitting
