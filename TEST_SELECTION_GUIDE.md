## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ Do's

1. **Match tests to role requirements**
   - Technical role = Technical tests
   - People manager = EQ + Leadership
   - Analytical role = Cognitive tests

2. **Limit total test time to 90 minutes max**
   - Candidate fatigue = worse results
   - 60-75 minutes is optimal

3. **Set realistic passing scores**
   - Entry-level: 60-65%
   - Mid-level: 70-75%
   - Senior: 75-85%

4. **Always include:**
   - At least 1 cognitive test
   - Communication skills (for most roles)
   - GDPR (if handling EU data)

5. **Make some tests optional**
   - Gives bonus insight
   - Doesn't auto-reject
   - Useful for tie-breaking

### ❌ Don'ts

1. **Don't over-test**
   - Too many tests = candidate drop-off
   - 3-6 tests is ideal

2. **Don't set pass scores too high**
   - 90%+ is unrealistic
   - 75-80% is already excellent

3. **Don't use personality tests as mandatory**
   - No "right" personality for most jobs
   - Use for cultural fit only

4. **Don't skip cognitive tests**
   - Best predictor of job success
   - Universal across roles

5. **Don't make ALL tests mandatory**
   - Allows for compensatory strengths
   - Reduces false negatives
